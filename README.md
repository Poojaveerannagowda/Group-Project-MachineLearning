# Music Recommendation system by  Tiffany Jason and Mitali

Collaborative filtering is a method of building recommendation
systems that use the totality of all user feedback
of all items to give recommendations. This feedback can be
either explicit, such as a 5-star rating, or implicit, such as a
listen count. We compare two collaborative filtering approaches
for recommending music based on a set of implicit feedback:
a neighborhood approach and a latent model approach. We
compare our results from these approaches with a third naive
popularity recommender as a baseline. Our results found that the
latent model approach performs the best while the neighborhood
and popularity approach are roughly equal.
